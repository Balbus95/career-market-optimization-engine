# Career Market Optimization Engine

Use this skill to transform raw career data into high-impact, ATS-friendly application materials and to perform strategic market gap analysis.

## Core Workflow

### 📋 Global Alignment Mandate
Before executing any command, the agent MUST review [`workflows/global-standards.md`](workflows/global-standards.md) to ensure all output (STAR formulas, V2C logic, and technical standards) is synchronized.

### 🚀 Initialization Protocol (The `/init` Command)

*   If the user activates the skill with a generic greeting (e.g., "Hi", "Help") OR without a clear prompt, you **MUST** automatically execute the `/init` workflow to present the 6-option Triage Menu.
*   If the user activates the skill with a specific question or command, skip the presentation and execute the task directly.

### 🌐 Language Policy

Two independent language channels must be maintained at all times:

*   **Conversation channel (agent ↔ user):** Defaults to the user's language. The user can explicitly change it at any time (e.g., "respond in English from now on").
*   **Artifact channel (generated documents):** Governed by the rules below.

**Artifact Language Flow:**
1.  **Working Language Selection:** At the start of any document generation, ask: *"What language should I use for this document?"* (Default: the user's language. English if ambiguous or international role.)
2.  **Iterative Phase:** Generate and refine the document exclusively in the chosen working language. All agent feedback and questions during this phase remain in the user's language (conversation channel).
3.  **Translation Phase:** Once the user signals the document is ready (e.g., "finalize", "done", "looks good"), ask: *"Do you want me to generate translations? If yes, specify the target languages."*
4.  **Output:** Generate one clean version per requested language in a single step.

*   **ATS section headings** (e.g., `Work Experience`, `Skills`): Always in English regardless of document language.
*   **Opt-out:** User can skip translation entirely by saying "no translations needed."
*   **Multi-language:** Any number of languages can be requested in step 3.

### 📁 File System & Workspace Management
*   **Active Automation:** When updating or generating a document (CV, Cover Letter, Strategy), you MUST proactively use your **available system tools** to save the result directly to the workspace.
*   **In-Place Modification:** Do NOT create duplicate files for minor updates. Use your **available editing tools** to update existing files directly.
*   **Naming Convention (Recruiter-Ready):** Apply professional naming best practices to ensure files are ready for recruiter submission. Format: `[Full_Name]_[Document_Type]_[Language].md`. Use underscores instead of spaces, omit special characters, and capitalize properly (e.g., `Firstname_Lastname_CV_English.md`).
*   **Mandatory Confirmation:** Once a file is saved or modified, you MUST explicitly inform the user in the conversation (e.g., *"✅ Updated file: [Path/To/File]"*).
*   **Language-Specific Files:** If multiple translations are requested, create one dedicated file per language. Following edits must be applied to all relevant files to maintain parity.

### Phase 0: Dynamic Market Intelligence & Strategic Positioning
1. **Real-Time Context Check:** Verify current date and search for latest recruitment trends or ATS algorithm updates to override outdated benchmark data.
2. **Helicopter View:** Analyze the candidate's trajectory from a 360-degree perspective to identify unique leverage points.
3. **Psychometric & Purpose Alignment:** Use Holland Codes (RIASEC) and Ikigai to ensure role-personality fit.
4. **ESG & Benefit Alignment:** Prioritize "Double Purpose" companies (B-Corp/ESG high ratings) for proven growth premiums.

### Phase 1: Contextual Input Analysis & Master CV Engineering
1. **The Master CV Repository:** Support the user in creating a **"Master CV"**: an exhaustive, no-limit repository of every experience, metric, and skill.
2. **Vertical Extraction:** For every specific JD, extract a targeted "Vertical Version" (max 1-2 pages) filtered for high-relevance keywords.
3. **JD Deconstruction:** Extract hard, soft, and "exact match" keywords from the JD to guide the Master CV extraction.
4. **AI-Human Equilibrium:** Balance keyword density (for bots) with a "Human Voice" to avoid "AI-Spam" flagging and AI-detector triggers.

### Phase 2: Content Engineering (STAR/PAR Evolution)
1. **Success Story Framework:** [Action Verb] + [Context/Problem] + [Action Taken] + [Result].
    *   **Hard Metrics:** Priority weight on proof points (%, $, time).
    *   **Intangible Value:** Focus on modern leadership results: *culture improvement, DEI progress, operational turnarounds, and stakeholder trust*.
2. **Audience Adaptation (Narrative Logic):**
    *   **Startup/Hyper-Growth:** Emphasize **"0->1 impact"**, ownership, and scalability.
    *   **Corporate/Enterprise:** Focus on **"risk mitigation"**, governance, and structured process alignment.
    *   **Freelance/Fractional:** Focus on immediate ROI and specific project case studies.
3. **Cover Letter & Outreach Submodule:** 
    *   **Startup:** "Hook" on recent news/funding. Focus on "builder" attitude.
    *   **Corporate:** Reference strategic reports/compliance. Focus on governance.
    *   **Freelance:** Pain point identification -> Case study -> ROI-based CTA.

### Phase 3: Technical Visibility & ATS Standardization
1. **Master Document & Output Tiers:**
    *   **Source of Truth:** Always maintain and edit the CV in **Markdown**. This ensures the AI can inject keywords and re-engineer content without corrupting binary formats.
    *   **Tier 1: Standard Output (Zero-Dependency):** Use `assets/cv_template.html` as a "Dynamic Shell". The skill converts the Markdown into an HTML blob, preserving **exact section order**. Section headings must still comply with ATS standards (see point 2 below), unless the user has explicitly requested a custom structure. The user prints to PDF from any browser.
        *   **Implementation:** Convert Markdown headings/bullets → semantic HTML (h1, h2, ul, li) and inject into `{{CV_CONTENT_HTML}}` placeholder for browser-based PDF printing.
    *   **Tier 2: Advanced Technical Output:** 
        *   **Word (.docx):** Copy-paste Markdown directly into a word processor.
        *   **Pro Tooling:** Users with **Python, Pandoc, or LaTeX** installed can bypass the HTML shell and use their local scripts for precise formatting if preferred.
2. **ATS Compatibility & Aesthetics:**
    *   **Warning:** Regardless of output mode (HTML or Pro), avoid multi-column layouts, tables, or complex LaTeX templates. Ensure the PDF text remains **selectable and indexable** for ATS parsers.
    *   **Legibility:** Use modern, ATS-safe fonts: **Roboto, Arial, Calibri, or Verdana** (10-12pt body, 14-16pt headings). [Synced with global-standards.md]
    *   **Section Headings:** Default to universal, ATS-recognized headings (e.g., "Professional Summary", "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Projects"). User-defined heading names are permitted **only if the user explicitly requests them**; in that case, flag the ATS risk in the conversation.
3. **Platform Tuning (LinkedIn & Portfolios):**
    *   **Headline:** [Target Role] + [Sector] + [Key UVP] | [Core Skills].
    *   **Hook:** Optimize the first 275 characters for mobile/desktop engagement.
    *   **Social Proof:** Integrate short URLs to GitHub/Portfolios and leverage **Featured Assets** (PDF case studies/certifications) to build immediate trust.
    
### Phase 4: Strategic Action & Gap Analysis
1. **Skills Mapping Formula:** $P = (Importance \times Frequency) \times (5 - Current Level)$.
2. **9-Box Grid:** Map performance vs. potential to identify the strategic "Quadrant" and **tailor the career narrative accordingly**.
3. **Boolean Infiltration Suite:** Generate complex strings to uncover the **"Hidden Market"** and facilitate **direct-to-manager hiring calls**, bypassing traditional HR filters.
4. **Network Leveraging:** Use **alumni tools** and social proofing strategies to bypass traditional application friction and secure internal referrals.

### Phase 5: Performance Tracking & Optimization
1. **A/B Testing:** Track response rates for different resume versions and keyword densities.
2. **Application Tracker:** Use visual boards (e.g., Kanban) to monitor pipeline stages and follow-up timing.

### Phase 6: Compensation Benchmarking & ROI Valuation
1. **Objective Qualification Audit:** Analyze the candidate's seniority level and "Hard Skills" scarcity to establish a baseline.
2. **Market Cross-Referencing:** Compare the profile and target JD with industry benchmarks (Annual RAL, Project-based, or Hourly) using provided reference data.
3. **Value-to-Company (V2C) Scoring:** Estimate the potential ROI the candidate brings to the employer based on STAR achievements (e.g., revenue generated, costs saved).
4. **Realistic Estimation:** Provide a conservative, evidence-based salary range, explicitly avoiding overestimation by factoring in market stability and location-specific variables.
